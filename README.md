# stream-event-points
**stream-event-points** is a Python project with multiple apps to manage custom points based on Twitch subs, bits, views, Patreon memberships, ... for stream entertainment.
The repositiry is organised in versions (v2023, v2024, v2025). It is *quite a mess* and I don't even know if all versions still work but feel free to inspire yourself from parts of it, if it can help you to code your own app.
